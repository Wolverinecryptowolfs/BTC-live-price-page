What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

Key Concepts
**Blockchain:** A distributed ledger technology that records all Bitcoin transactions.
**Mining:** The process by which new Bitcoins are entered into circulation and new transactions are verified.
**Wallets:** Digital wallets used to store, send, and receive Bitcoin.
**Private and Public Keys:** Cryptographic keys used to secure and authorize transactions.
How it Works
Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009.

The supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, making it a deflationary currency.

Is Bitcoin for You?
Investing in Bitcoin carries risks and is not suitable for everyone. It's important to do your own research and understand the technology before investing.
